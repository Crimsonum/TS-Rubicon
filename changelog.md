## Definitions (A Guide For Newbies):

- **Acceleration rate** means how fast the object will accelerate. The higher the rate, the faster the object will accelerate. Note that different object types may use different acceleration units.
- **Ambient damage** is the base amount of damage dealt along the weapon's line of fire. It allows the weapon to pierce and damage multiple targets. Only certain special weapons, like railguns and sonic waves, can deal ambient damage.
- **Armor** comes in five types: none, wood, light, heavy, and concrete. Each armor type has its own strengths and weaknesses. Generally, the heavier the armor, the more resistant it is to small arms, but also more susceptible to armor-piercing warheads.
- **Cell** is the basic map grid unit. Vehicles and aircraft occupy one cell each. Buildings can occupy multiple cells.
- **Damage** is the base amount of damage dealt by a single shot of the weapon. The amount of actual hitpoints deduced from the victim is damage multiplied with the weapon's effectiveness against the target's armor type (and in case the target is an infantry unit, whether it's standing, prone or flying).
- **Damage spread** controls the damage falloff from the warhead's point of impact. The larger the value, the farther damage spreads.
- **Deceleration rate** means how fast the object will slow down. Note that higher values result in *slower* deceleration rate. Also note that different object types may use different deceleration units.
- **Lepton** is the smallest distance unit in the game. A lepton is 1/256th of a cell edge's length.
- **Range** is measured in cells.
- **ROF**, despite standing for rate-of-fire, is actually the cooldown of the weapon. Hence a lower ROF value means higher rate-of-fire.
- **Scatter** is the ability for the unit to scatter automatically from enemy fire and to avoid getting crushed by heavy vehicles. Some units gain this ability when reaching veteran or elite rank.
- **Slowdown distance** is the distance to the destination at which point the unit will begin to decelerate. It is measured in leptons.
- **Speed** is the maximum speed of the object. However, the actual speed of an object depends on the object's "locomotor", with different types of objects having different locomotors. Hence a mech and a tank with the same speed value may actually have very different speeds in-game.
- **Strength** is the base amount of hitpoint an object has.
